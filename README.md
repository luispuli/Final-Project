## "Accounting for education enhancement effects on population growth dynamics: A wealth gap perspective"

This paper presents an exploration of the relationship between education and population
growth rate using machine learning algorithms which, by taking a different perspective from
the commonly used time series analysis, aims to shed light on the role of education in
understanding demographic dynamics. The research leverages advanced regression
techniques with a focus on regularization to test a set of hypotheses concerning gender
disparities in education within different types of economies.
